## What I did

-   Developed a responsive website using **HTML**, **CSS(SASS)** and **JavaScript**
-   Used animation library **GSAP** (core, ScrollTrigger) for the front-end.
-   Implemented **Firebase Authentication** to anonymously sign in users.
-   Used **Firestore** as the database to store information about the listings and user details.
-   Implemented **Firebase Storage** to store the images of the designs.
-   Hosted the website with **Firebase Hosting**.
-   Created **two admin web apps** (HTML, CSS, JS) one to facilitate uploading of new designs and the other for managing the appointments.

```
NOTE: I did not know how to use git and GitHub at that time,
so there is only one large commit with the whole website ðŸ˜….

##### Approximate development time frame: May â€“ August 2021
