                            passionate and self-taught henna artist. Henna has
                            always been my favorite hobby🤷🏻‍♀️, I remember myself
                            as a kid always wanting henna on my hands for all
                            occasions and my mom had to get it done. A little
                            flower drawn and I was over the moon😅 so yeah here
                            I come with my little business to share the joy.

                            meticulous about my work, I take all my time and
                            make sure my clients get satisfaction whenever they
                            get their henna done at my place. I make sure to
                            provide the best to them through their desired
                            designs. So ladies, have a look at
